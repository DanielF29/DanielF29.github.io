# About Me

I'm a passionate Ph.D. Student at Tecnológico de Monterrey, campus Guadalajara, working on Explainable AI (XAI) and Causality, particularly causal discovery and causal learning with and applied to deep learning feature selection. The main area where I have applied my research approaches and methods is on medical images, mainly kidney stones. 
I've developed a keen interest in applying my skills to solve complex problems, innovate, and contribute to the field of technology.
Also, I like to know about ML/AI, games, gadgets, innovations, and space.
