[Robust Interpretability with Self-Explaining Deep Learning Models for Computer-Assisted Classification of Kidney Stones in Endoscopic Images](/pdfs/Robust_XAI.pdf)

Developing "robust interpretability" in kidney stone classification using deep learning is crucial due to the high-stakes nature of healthcare decisions. deep learning offers a promising alternative for more efficient and less invasive classification, but the lack of interpretability in these models presents a significant challenge. 
Healthcare professionals must be able to develop trust in their tools, even for DL based ones. 
Enhancing robust interpretability in AI models for kidney stone classification advances the technology's efficacy and ensures its alignment with the critical needs for transparency, trust, and ethical decision-making in medical
diagnostics. Hence the proposed research topic on Robust Interpretability.
