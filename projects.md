# Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

**[Prototipical_Parts](https://github.com/DanielF29/Prototipical_Parts):** 

Python code and bash files to train and explain prototypical parts learned by the Prototypical Part Network as part of the work "Deep Prototypical-Parts Ease Morphological Kidney Stone Identification and are Competitively Robust to Photometric Perturbations".

**[Netlogo_Complexity measurement on a MAS](https://github.com/DanielF29/Netlogo_Complexity-measurement-on-a-MAS).**

**[SC2-Q-Learning](https://github.com/DanielF29/SC2-Q-Learning):** 

Q-learning applied to the real-time strategy game StarCraft 2 (SC2).

**[Identification and PID control for a quadrocopter](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6808571):**

 Hierarchical quadcopter position and orientation control, with a Kalman filter applied for the sensor signals' preprocessing.

__Abstract__: "Identification and control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) has been a topic of interest in recent years due to several applications they are used for, some examples could be: surveillance or cooperative robotics. This paper shows the parameter identification and control of the AR Drone®, a quadrocopter from Parrot®; the parameter identification was achieved using experimental data from the physical system. For the control part a PID control was used to regulate all the variables of the Drone."
