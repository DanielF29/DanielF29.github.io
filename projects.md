# Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- **Project 1**: Python code and bash files to train and explain prototypical parts learned by the Prototypical Part Network as part of the work "Deep Prototypical-Parts Ease Morphological Kidney Stone Identification and are Competitively Robust to Photometric Perturbations", [Prototipical_Parts](https://github.com/DanielF29/Prototipical_Parts).

- **Project 2**: [Netlogo_Complexity measurement on a MAS](https://github.com/DanielF29/Netlogo_Complexity-measurement-on-a-MAS).

- **Project 3**: Q-learning applied to the real-time strategy game StarCraft 2 (SC2), [SC2-Q-Learning](https://github.com/DanielF29/SC2-Q-Learning).

- **Project 4**: Hierarchical quadcopter position and orientation control, with a Kalman filter applied for the sensor signals' preprocessing.
